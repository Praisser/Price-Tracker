REQUIREMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
PROJECT: Multi-Website Price Tracker

=================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
=================================================

The goal of this project is to build a web-based price comparison system that allows users to search for a product and compare its prices across multiple e-commerce websites. The system does not require user login and displays the best available price along with direct purchase links.

The application uses web scraping to fetch prices and presents the data on a clean dashboard interface.

=================================================
2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
=================================================

FR1: Product Search
- User should be able to enter a product name.
- System should accept free-text search queries.

FR2: Web Scraping
- System should scrape product prices from multiple websites.
- Each website must have a dedicated scraper.

FR3: Price Comparison
- System should compare prices across all sources.
- Best (lowest) price should be identified automatically.

FR4: Display Results
- Display prices in a tabular format.
- Highlight the best deal.
- Provide a clickable "Buy Now" link.

FR5: Caching
- Previously searched products should be cached.
- Cached data should be reused within a fixed time window.

FR6: Error Handling
- Handle invalid searches gracefully.
- Show appropriate messages if scraping fails.

=================================================
3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
=================================================

NFR1: Performance
- Results should load within reasonable time.
- Avoid unnecessary scraping.

NFR2: Scalability
- System should support adding more websites easily.

NFR3: Maintainability
- Code should be modular and well-organized.

NFR4: Security & Ethics
- Do not bypass authentication or CAPTCHAs.
- Scrape only publicly available data.

NFR5: Usability
- UI should be simple and responsive.
